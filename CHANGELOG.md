# Changelog

All notable changes to this project. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Workload specs and seeded traces of chat, RAG and one-off traffic, with each request's shared prefix worked out
  exactly; `irb trace generate` and `irb trace stats`.
- An open-loop streaming load client that times TTFT per request and records its own lateness; run summaries with
  goodput; the model servers' prefix-cache and request counters read before and after every run.
- Result files that name their trace and model servers, `irb report` (refusing unfair comparisons) and `irb chart`.
- Four routers on kind, each on its own cluster with fresh simulated vLLM pods: a Kubernetes Service, and the llm-d
  Router v1.0.0 with load-aware, prefix-aware and combined scoring, fail closed; in CI on every push.
